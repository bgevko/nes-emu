Welcome to my NES Emulator, written in C++!

It currently supports:
- Controller and keyboard input support
- Graphics and sound
- Compatibility for mappers 1, 2, and 3 (roughly 80% of titles)
- Debugging windows
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Saving and loading states

Here's a quick working demo:

_The best software is written in 2-passes_ ~probably someone. That's why I decided to rewrite it in Rust! More to come soon.

For anyone looking to run this software themselves, I've included some guides below.
