# CLion Mac OS

## Build Settings

In CLion terminal, run the setup check script
```bash
.scripts/env-check.sh
```

Using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), isntall the missing dependencies
```bash
brew install llvm cmake pkg-config ninja
```

Rerun the script. If the installations are still red, you must add the value of `brew --prefix` to your PATH variable. If you're not sure how to do that, check out [this](https://www.architectryan.com/2012/10/02/add-to-the-path-on-mac-os-x-mountain-lion/#.Uydjga1dXDg) article. 

At this point, only `vcpkg` should be red.

Take note of the installation paths for `clang` and `clang++`, you will need them.

In Clion, got to Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → Toolchains.

Adjust the name of the default toolchain (or create a new one). I'll call mine Clang Toolchain.

Adjust the C and C++ compiler paths to match your installation paths. Yours may be different from mine. Mine are:
- C Compiler: `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/clang`
- C++ Compiler: `/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/clang++`

Just below **Toolchains**, go to **CMake**

Click the plus button to add a new profile. I’ll name mine Mac_CLion

Set these fields:
- Build type: Release
- Toolchain: Clang Toolchain
- Generator: Use default (Ninja)
- CMake options
```cmake
-DBUILD_FRONTEND=ON
-DBUILD_TESTS=ON
```

Click OK. The project will try to build but fail. You'll need to install Vcpkg.

## Building the Project

Go to View → Tool Windows → Vcpkg

Look for the Vcpkg panel in the bottom left tool panel.

Click on the plus icon to add Vcpkg. In the installation window, select the CMake profile you created earlier and click OK.

Vcpkg will install and adjust your CMake settings. To see what it changed, go back to Settings → Build, Execution, Deployment → CMake.

Under **CMake options**, notice the new `DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` entry. This points to the Vcpkg installation and helps install and resolve C++ packages.

You'll now also be able to adjust various build settings under **Cache variables**

Click OK and rebuild the project

Try to run the **emu** target from the top-right corner

![Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 4 36 47 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/262148ee-3be4-4621-b98a-2fe69b008e0d)

The emulator window should open.

Select the **AllCTest** target and click the dots on the far right to edit the test settings

![Screenshot 2025-02-13 at 4 40 44 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c7fd5b7-455d-4073-89d1-759fed5faa96)

Add `-j 2` in **CTest arguments** to allow your tests to run in parallel using 2 cores. Adjust to as many cores as your machine allows.

Run the **AllCTeset** target and verify it works.
