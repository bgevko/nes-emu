# CLI Tools

## Setup Check
```bash
scripts/env-check.sh --extras
```

## Building the Project
```bash
scripts/build.sh
```

You can also build it manually from the project root
```bash
cmake --preset=default
cmake --build --preset=default
```

The build uses CMake presets defined in `CMakePresets.json`
- **default:** core + tests + frontend
- **debug:** default, but with symbols.
- **tests:** core + tests, no frontend
- **ci:** core + tests, no frontend, for docker use only

You can run a specific preset:
```bash
scripts/build.sh <preset>
```

### Local Presets
You can also define your own. To do so, create a `CMakeUserPresets.json` file in the project root:
```json
{
  "version": 6,
  "cmakeMinimumRequired": {
    "major": 3,
    "minor": 28,
    "patch": 3
  },
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "my-preset",
      "inherits": "default",
      "description": "My custom build preset",
      "environment": {
        "VCPKG_ROOT": "<path-to-my-vcpkg"
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildPresets": [
    {
      "name": "my-preset",
      "configurePreset": "default",
      "jobs": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

You can set any settings local to your environment. This file is not tracked in GitHub.

Run your preset with:
```bash
scripts/build.sh my-preset
```

See the official CMake [docs](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) for more information.

## Clang Tidy
Theoretically, linting locally with `clang-tidy` version 19+ probably gives the same result as the CI/CD check. **IN THEORY**

**Note**: If you're running these from the CLI in CLion, your build directory (`-p <build>`) might be different.

Lint and fix a single file
```bash
clang-tidy -p build -header-filter='.*' -fix <path-to-file>
```

Lint and fix all files
```bash
for file in $(find core/ include/ -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h'); do
	clang-tidy -p build -header-filter='.*' -fix "$file"
done
```

## Clang Format
If you're not running these from the project root, include the `--style=file:<path-to-.clang-format>` flag.

Format a single file
```bash
clang-format -i <path-to-file>
```

Format all files
```bash
for file in $(find core/ include/ -name '*.cpp' -o -name '*.h'); do
	clang-format -i "$file"
done
```

## Testing
Run all tests in parallel
```bash
scripts/test.sh
```

Run a single test. See the list of test names [here](https://github.com/bgevko/nes-emu/blob/docs/docs/Test_Names.md).
```bash
scripts/test.sh <test-name>
```

You can run these manually from your build directory as well:
```
cd build
ctest -j <cores>
# ctest -R <test-name>
```
