# This workflow is used for deploying the Docker container based on the
# docker/alpine-Dockerfile to the GitHub Container Registry.

# The workflow is only triggered manually, as this should be an infrequent
# operation. The only time it should be triggered is when the Dockerfile
# or entrypoint.sh script is updated.

# The workflow uses the docker Buildx tool to build the Docker
# container for both the amd64 and arm64 architectures. The workflow then
# logs in to the GitHub Container Registry, builds the Docker container, and
# pushes it to the GitHub Container Registry.
